# MG-VB-Template
A MonoGame DesktopGL VB.NET Starter Project

This is a translation of the default MonoGame DesktopGL C# project into VB.NET
It was made by me in about an hour.
I do not know much of the way you write code in VB.NET, this was cobbled together from informed guesses, MSDN pages, stack overflow and the IntelliSense auto-complete suggestions.
If you find anything wrong, please do tell me.

feel free to use this in your projects however you want

credit is appreciated but not at all nescessary
